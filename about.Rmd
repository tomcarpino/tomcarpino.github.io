### About this site

Sometimes you need to say a bit about the site -- how it was made, where it's hosted, where the source code can be found. 

This website was made using Rstudio by Tom Carpino. 

Last update on October 18, 2018. 

If this is for a project or analysis, I recommend giving some details about the R package versions that you used to create the content.

Here is some more text. 
Holy cow!
